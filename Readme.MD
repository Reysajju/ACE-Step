# Fooocus & Juggernaut XL: AI Image Generation Powerhouse

[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/<YOUR_USERNAME>/<YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME>/blob/main/Fooocus_Juggernaut_Generator.ipynb)

This repository provides a Google Colab notebook and setup instructions for generating high-quality images using [Fooocus](https://github.com/lllyasviel/Fooocus) with the powerful [Juggernaut XL](https://civitai.com/models/133005/juggernaut-xl) model. Generate stunning visuals with intuitive controls, suitable for artists, designers, and AI enthusiasts.

## Features

*   **Easy to Use:** Leverages Fooocus's user-friendly interface.
*   **High-Quality Images:** Powered by the Juggernaut XL model, known for its excellent detail and aesthetic appeal.
*   **Colab Ready:** Click the "Open in Colab" badge above to run directly in your browser with a free GPU.
*   **Local Setup Instructions:** Guidance for running on your own compatible GPU.
*   **Customizable:** Easily change prompts, aspect ratios, styles, and advanced settings.

## Example Output

**(Consider adding 1-2 impressive example images generated by your notebook here. You can embed them in the README after uploading them to your GitHub repo.)**

E.g., `![Example Image 1](path/to/your/example_image1.png)`

## Prerequisites for Local Setup

*   **Python:** Version 3.10 or later recommended.
*   **Git:** For cloning this repository.
*   **NVIDIA GPU:** A CUDA-enabled GPU with at least 8GB VRAM is recommended for Juggernaut XL. More VRAM (12GB+) will provide a smoother experience and allow for higher resolutions.
*   **CUDA Toolkit & cuDNN:** Ensure you have the appropriate NVIDIA drivers, CUDA Toolkit, and cuDNN installed. Check Fooocus and PyTorch documentation for compatible versions.
*   **Disk Space:** Sufficient disk space for Python, dependencies, Fooocus, and the Juggernaut XL model (which can be several gigabytes).

## Setup & Usage

### Option 1: Run in Google Colab (Recommended for ease of use)

1.  Click the "Open In Colab" badge at the top of this README.
2.  The notebook will open in Google Colab. Ensure you have a GPU runtime selected ("Runtime" > "Change runtime type" > "GPU").
3.  Follow the instructions within the notebook cells to install dependencies, download the model, and launch Fooocus.

### Option 2: Run Locally on Your Own GPU

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/<YOUR_USERNAME>/<YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME>.git
    cd <YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME>
    ```

2.  **Set up a virtual environment (recommended):**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    # On Windows
    venv\Scripts\activate
    # On macOS/Linux
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    *(Note: The `Fooocus_Juggernaut_Generator.ipynb` notebook itself might also contain cells to install/clone Fooocus directly if that's how your current Colab notebook operates. Adjust `requirements.txt` and these instructions accordingly.)*

4.  **Download the Juggernaut XL Model:**
    *   You need to download the Juggernaut XL model file (e.g., `.safetensors`). A common source is [Civitai](https://civitai.com/models/133005/juggernaut-xl) or Hugging Face.
    *   Place the downloaded model file into the correct Fooocus model directory. Typically, this is:
        `Fooocus/models/checkpoints/`
        (If Fooocus is cloned/installed within your project directory, this path will be relative to that.)
        *You might need to create the `checkpoints` folder if it doesn't exist.*

5.  **Launch Jupyter Notebook/Lab:**
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    # OR
    jupyter lab
    ```
    Then open the `Fooocus_Juggernaut_Generator.ipynb` notebook.

6.  **Run the Notebook Cells:**
    *   Follow the instructions in the notebook. This will typically involve:
        *   Pointing Fooocus to the Juggernaut XL model if not automatically detected.
        *   Launching the Fooocus Gradio web interface.

## Customization

*   **Prompts:** Modify the text prompts in the Fooocus interface to guide image generation.
*   **Negative Prompts:** Use negative prompts to specify what you *don't* want in the image.
*   **Styles:** Experiment with the various style presets available in Fooocus.
*   **Advanced Settings:** Adjust parameters like aspect ratio, seed, CFG scale, sampler, steps, etc., for finer control.
*   **Model Selection:** The notebook is configured for Juggernaut XL, but you can adapt it for other Stable Diffusion models compatible with Fooocus by placing them in the `Fooocus/models/checkpoints/` directory and selecting them in the Fooocus UI.

## Troubleshooting

*   **CUDA Errors:** Ensure your NVIDIA drivers, CUDA Toolkit, and PyTorch CUDA version are compatible.
*   **Out of Memory (OOM):** Juggernaut XL can be memory-intensive. Try reducing image resolution/batch size, or ensure you have sufficient VRAM.
*   **Fooocus Issues:** Refer to the official [Fooocus GitHub Issues](https://github.com/lllyasviel/Fooocus/issues) page for common problems and solutions.
